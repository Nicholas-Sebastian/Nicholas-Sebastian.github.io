For me I love working with my computer, ever since I got to play around with my Dads old work laptop. During High School I met my cousin from the mainland who works as a Data Analysis
specialist. It was interesting to here his thoughts on his time in college and what he does for work. Taking interest in this I decided to put my efforts towards MIS and aim to learn 
about it. So far it has been very interesting and makes me appreciate technology more. I also love helping my friends or family with any tech problems they have, for example I built
my parents their own PC and I showed them the ropes on how to operate it. To me it is fun and interesting to help people with comptuers, this is because while technology is vast there 
are still many things to learn and do with technology. 

As a college student now there are many hurdles I still need to get over, however I believe all the hard stuff helps me get stronger and smarter for the future. Personally I haven't
been too knowlegeable about GitHub, JSON, or even Command Line but as I learn its contents and reliability I have been getting more use to them. As of now ITM 352 is my starting point into 
MIS and so far it has been an interesting class. Learning about different coding, software, and how I could use these for my future job opens many new options for my future. While there
there is still much to learn not only in this class but for the future classes to come I will take what I learned and use it effectively not only for my job but for my personal use as well.

For me I do not know what the future holds. I do know however that while still in college there is a much greater journey ahead. The reason why I chose to go into MIS is that 
its aspects and content relate to me on a personal level. Other than peaking my interest I believe that future jobs will be relying on people who specialize in this field. From this course
I believe that will be learning new skills and improving old ones which I will be using in future classes and for the workforce. By learning and doing the work I can tell that I will
have a good semester.
