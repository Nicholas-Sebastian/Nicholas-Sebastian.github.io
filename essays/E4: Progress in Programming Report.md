My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
Over the couse of the semester to now I have known some details on progamming in Java, node.js, and HTML. 
Now having been doing various labs, WODs, and readings I believe that I have improved my programming skills. I have also been getting use to learning new things
such as new functions, GET/POST methods, and building my own server. I was very interesting to see and learn how servers read, request, and send data of various files
to other web pages without having to use the files on a personal computer, rather uploading it to a dedicated server (like UH's one) and using that to start up the server for 
my files.
 
I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
Personally I do still have much to learn. While the readings, labs, and WOD's did help I am still very reliant on them. It also takes me time to figure out what I want 
my code to do, even it being as so simple as to update the date on a web page in real time. I also need to work on my commenting skills and utalizing them to outline, 
document, and label the different areas in my code. That way I can be more organized in my coding and it wont be so hard to navigate through the different pages of code.

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
While I did learn a lot from the WODs it did give a very easy way of doing the code, at times I found my self even almost copying the screencast. 
However I developed a way of doing and figuring out the WODs. First I utalize the readings and lectures on trying to do the WODs for my first attempt. If I do 
come to an outcome I try to make it faster when timing myself, however when I'm stuck I do rely on the WODs as guidance and from there I look back at my code and see 
how I can improve it. 

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
The labs do help me, especially for Assignemnt 1. Because Assignemnt 1 was a combination of past labs I was able to figure out and layout how I want my 
webpage to look like. The various labs was also good beginning practice on slowly laying out the bigger picture of an assignemnt.

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
While personally I did have a hard time with Assignment 1, that was only due to very bad time management on my part. Assignment one however was very interesting. 
I learned that it is important to plan before coding, there were many steps I made to making this Assignment 1. Firstly making/getting all the files, html, or json files
created and ready to go before typing. The hardest part for me was when after getting the index, product_display, and the invoice working was the action of trying to POST
to the server. Out of all the parts in the Assignment that one was the one I spent the most time on. Luckly some classmates and I got together and did trial and error runs 
to figure out and discuss the origin of the problems. In all it was an interesting and hard assignment, but with that done Assignment 2 is coming up. Personally I am a little
intimidated on the contents of Assignemnt 2, but I will try my best in finishing the Assignment and I hope to make it better than Assignment 1.


I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
Persoanlly I think that during labs it would be better to go over everything step by step, I do understand that it is our duty to also learn the content by the readings,
WODs, and screencast. I can't say for everyonen in the class but personally I am not the best when learning when just following instructions from the Lab. I like to be hands on
however I do also want to understand the material given. I believe that an addition of screencast for labs could be helpful because while yes the lectures are recorded, sometimes
some material aren't explained well (however that's just my opinion).

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
Personally the assets I rely on the most in this class would be the Labs, readings, working with a classmate, and the screencasts (WOD/Lab/Lecture). I personally can learn
a lot from Labs but I do tend to be very forgetful and will turn to recordings, screencast, or classmates for asistance.
