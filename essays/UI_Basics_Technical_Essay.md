When doing the first 3 WODs assignments I was confused at first, however after reading and watching the screencast in the Athletic approach module it was easy to do. 
Before I attempted to record my Rx time I wanted to get practice in. The first thing I did was to watch the screen cast of each WOD, after I tried to do it on my own. 
After my attempt I viewed it in the browser and if it matched the example given then my code was good. If I did see something different or some mistakes in the browser I went back 
and fixed my code using the screencast as a base. For these practice attepmts my average time was 16~20 minutes. When I think I was ready I went to try attepmt for an Rx score. 
For my screencast I recorded my attempts using OBS studio and I used the base timer provided by windows, I also kept track of my scores in an excel sheet I made. Along with the excel 
sheet I put my attempt times in my WODs Practice directory to show how efficient I became when doing these WODs.

On the first WOD "BrowserHistory1" the instructions were straight forward and easy to follow. On my first few attpemts I took my time averaging around 12~20 minutes, I did this so I 
was able to get a feel of what goes where or how things worked in the code. While the first WOD being the longest one out of the three I was able to make a good Rx time of 12:27 minutes.
I was happy with this result because my practice of learning and understanding the code paid off.

For the second WOD "BrowserHistory2" this was easier than the first, we were able to copy our html file from BrowserHistory1 to BrowserHistory2 which made 
things easier and faster. For this WOD we basically had to make an external CSS file to format and style out html file. This was very
fast to do because we only had to make the "style.css" file, link it to our main html file, and finally write out the properties as listed in the instructions. For me this took
about three attempts however after learning the basics of a CSS file it was a breeze to do. My Rx time was 04:55 and it was very simple.

Like BrowserHistory2 we did the same first step for BrowserHistory3 which was copying the html and css file (I also copied in my Images directory) into the directory. In this
WOD we were tasked into making our different website infos into colums while chaing the the "Table of Contents" into hyperlinks. At first this was difficult for me but with 
practice I was able to do this efficiently. While this did take some time to learn just like BrowserHistory1 I was able to get a good time score for my finaly attempt. My Rx socre 
for this WOD was 07:21, while not being the fastest time compared to BrowserHistory2 it was faster than BrowserHistory1. 

From these three WODs I was able to learn a good bit on how to format an html webpage and learning on how to use CSS files to make my webpages look nicer and professional.
