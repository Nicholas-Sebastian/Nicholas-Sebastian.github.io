Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
What did you learn from this assignment?

- For Assignment 2 our task was to utalize our website from Assignment 1 and implement a login & registration page. (link to my github page: https://github.com/Nicholas-Sebastian/ITM352_S22_repo/tree/main/Sebastian_Nicholas_Assignment2_). We were also tasked with making our website having a loop system through registration > login > Invoice, by having the user either having to register a new account or use an already existing account to login before checking out to the invoice. The user was not able to access the invoice without having an account, we also neede to make sure quanitites of products was carried over from our products page > login/registration > invoice. What I learned from this assignment was that there were multiple ways of having data pulled from one page to another, however for my website I wanted to use query strings because I was more accustomed to it. It was also interesting to learn how to read and write to a file and utalize contents into the file to move to another page.

Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

- I did not work with a partner for Assignment 2, however I was thinking of maybe partnering up with someone for Assignment 3.


How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

- For help I worked with some classmates for small bits of help, however one such part was trying to get quantities to move from products page > login/registration > invoice. There was also an instance where I was trying to figure out how to store information from the registration page to use later in the login. I used lab examples as well as ask for assistance from some classmates on the matter.


How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
- The different part for Assignment 2 compared to Assignment 1 was looping the webpages. For example in Assignment 1 the steps were; index > products > invoice. However for Assignment 2 it went from index > products > login/register == Invoice, meaning that without correct login/registration the user wouldn't be able to access the invoice page. Another difference was the carrying of data of the quantities to different pages. 

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

- When working on this Assignment I first spent about 15% of the time thinking how it would work, the next 30% was laying out the different webpages and checking if they worked, then I had to update the server with new get request and post functions to be able to work with the new pages which took about 20%, the last remaing 35% went to debugging and solving other issues related to Assignment 2 and past issues from Assignment 1.

Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

- For me that worked well with this assignemt was planning how I wanted to the Webpages to work, another thing that went well was debugging and testing, utualizing the debugging tool helped solve many errors and failed posting from my server. What did not work well was trying to add new things before testig and fixing old problems from Assignment 1.

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

- I would try to do the Assignment much easier, another thing I would try to do is Fix any issues and errors from Assignment 1 before attempting Assignment 2. This is because I mostly tried to fix Assignment 1 errors during debugging and testing in Assignment 2.
