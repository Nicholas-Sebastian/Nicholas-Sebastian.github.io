Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
- My website is a online store that sells Adidas goods. Goods from shoes, shirts, shorts, and other accessories.

Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
- Some features that I was not able to implement was additional cart features, a better UI/Layout for my website, and I was not sure if my IR7 was sucessful. There are also a few bugs in the code, one such code was when updating a users profile there would be a non-stop loop however after awhie it brought the user to the page.

Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
- I was mostly proud of being able to get the websites base working.
Describe what you are least happy with your system:
- There were many things i wasn't happy about in my project. The parts in my system that made me least happy was the sessions, cart, and UI design of my project.

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
- The use of sessions, cookies, and mail were very difficult. The other portion which made it difficult for me personally was the individual requirement. 
When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
- I first tried looking at class examples, labs, and recordings. Next I would ask for advice from classmates and look through online resources. I also emailed Professor Port for problems regarding my Individual requirement.
Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
- Starting from scratch did work well for me, however when getting to the main requirements for A3 it became harder and harder. 
Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
- I honestly should have started much earlier on the assignment, starting from scratch was good however I did not have best timing on working on the project.
What did you learn from doing this assignment?
- Other than time management, I learned that sessions are very interesting on keeping users carts or information separate from each other.
If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
- For me I would have wanted to start earlier and get more help with Professor Port. 
Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
- a(35%), b(50%), c(15%)
Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. 
Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
- I did not work with a team member
