I wasn't able to submit the Smartphones WOD however I did Invoice1 WOD. For the invoices 1 It was very fun to learn. 
It was interesting on how to use different types of variables (floats, numbers, and strings) for this WOD. I tried it on my own at first and almost got it, however I was having trouble
on the table area. I then watched the video and saw that I was on the right track however I just needed to figure out how I would want to make the table. I just used the same table style given
in the WOD example and it worked perfectly. I will go back and practice Smartphone1 WODs so that I am prepared for Smartphone2 WOD.
