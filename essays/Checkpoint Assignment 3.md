Screen Cast: https://youtu.be/Byam4AgNLvw

Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear. 
- (PPT Screencast)

Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. 
That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? 
If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.
- I plan to make the cart a separate page from the product page, I find it easier beacuse it will work like the Invoice page. To do this I plan to make a similar system from the Invoice for the cart page to take the quanitites of products and just calculate how much the carts total is, however I will not add shipping to the total cost rather that will be done in the invoice page. For the user to know the shipping cost I will put shipping information in the cart page along with a purchase button to send the user to the invoice page. 

Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. 
In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data).
- For the shopping cart data I plan to make sure each user has a different session so that any items they put in their cart wont conflict with other users. 

Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.

How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?
- I want to utilize the session expire lab/example from w3schools to auto logout a user in a specified time if they do not change pages or intereact with the website. One idea I wanted to try was to have time expire (logged in or not) to automatically send the website back to the index page. 

Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)
- At the moment I am currently using a template borrowed from w3schools, I may also utilize css codes to enhance the UI of the website.

If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?
- For Assignment 3 I do not plan on working with a partner. 

How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?
- Persoanlly I was not too happy about my Assignment 2 on its presentation and function. For Assignment 3 I wanted to restart from scratch and made cleaner code as well as fix any problems from both my Assignment 1 and Assignment 2. While I am not working with a partner I am reaching out to classmates on how they structred their webpage. This will help me get an idea of what I want to do for my website and while I am still borrowing examples and code I will make sure that I referece any code I get. For my IR7 part however I will save that for last until I make sure I have a full functional website.
